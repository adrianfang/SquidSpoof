    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>If you are seeing this website on a site you typically visit, your network is susceptible to DNS Cache Poisoning. This is pretty serious, as any person on the network will have complete control of the sites you visit. Someone on your network has decided to test out its security, successfully exploiting the vulnerabilities of the DNS protocol and redirecting you here!</p>
    <h2>What is DNS and DNS Spoofing?</h2>
    <p>DNS or Domain Name System, is the method that is used to direct users from readable domain names into IP Addresses. Without it, users would have to memorise convoluted numeric values to connect to servers. The shortcomings in the DNS protocol is that it lacks encryption by default in most networks. This enables hackers to join a network and poison the DNS Cache of any device connected to it, forcing for users to connect to malicious and fraudulent servers as opposed to the genuine destination.</p>
    <h2>Securing your network</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypt your DNS Traffic - Hackers will be unable to view your DNS queries and send spoofed responses back. Please research DNSSEC. If you are not the network administrator, you could use a VPN to encrypt your traffic.</li>
            <li>Monitor your Network for ARP and NDP Spoofing - Finding duplicate hardware addresses (MAC) in your ARP or NDP cache indicates that something malicious is going on within the network! There are two commands that you can use to monitor your ARP and NDP caches, which are <code>arp -a</code> and <code>ndp -a</code> respectively.</li>
            <li>If you are on a home network, look for any suspicious devices that are connected to the network and act on them.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Best of luck to you, internet traveller!</h2>

# SquidSpoof
My first project going into IB Computer Science: a script that can put a network's security to the test, and seeing if they are susceptible to DNS Spoofing of an IPv4 nameserver! Made for educational purposes only.

I will likely add some more documentation to give users (especially to my teacher) how to use the script.
